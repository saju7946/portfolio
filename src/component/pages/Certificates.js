I learned how to break complex problems into simpler subproblems, solve them recursively, and combine the solutions efficiently. I explored classic algorithms such as merge sort, quicksort, and binary search, analyzing their time complexities using techniques like the master method and recurrence relations.</p><p>I also developed an appreciation for randomized algorithms, including randomized quicksort and QuickSelect, learning how randomization can lead to simpler and often faster solutions in practice. Additionally, I applied these algorithms to real-world problems like closest pair of points and integer multiplication, enhancing my skills in both algorithm design and mathematical analysis.</p><p>By completing the course, I improved my ability to design efficient algorithms, reason about their performance, and apply them to both theoretical and practical problemsâ€”an essential foundation for advanced computer science studies and technical interviews."</p></>
